# React exercise with an API Integration

Language: React
Estimate duration: 3h
Purpose:

The goal of the exercise is simple: build an app that display a list of all cat breeds and a single detailed page of a certain breed.
Use the cat API (https://thecatapi.com/).

On the home page

    display a list of all cats breeds,
    on each one, a link to go to detail view
    allow the user to search in the breeds list

On the detail view (single breed page)

    some infos regarding the current breed
    a header with a principal image
        Bonus: slider of thumbnails to switch between images (hint: get 5 images of the same breed from the API)
    a button to add/remove from favorites list (keep the favorites on reload)
    make sure to use a router

On the favorites page

    a list of breeds that were added to favorites
    a button to clear this list

Hint

    handle errors
    you can use axios or native fetch to retrieve data from api.
    you can use create-react-app

Bonus

    Add a new page that shows random images with filters (file type : (gif / png / jpg) and/or categories)
    Use React hooks is better
    Use Store Management (Redux, Zustand, ...)
    Use TypeScript
    Add some tests
    A “clean looking” design
    You can create a form 'Find my lovely cat", in order to find the cat you always wanted (fluffy cat, by color ... )
    Anything you want, be creative !
